Here is the Dashboard using Tableau for the Minnesota Traffic Interstate Traffic Volume from Google Business Intelligence Certificate activity.
  The Dashboard was made from Minnesota Department of Transportation data during the years from 2016-2018.
  I was requested to track: traffic volume throughout the year; by year, month, week, day, and hour, traffic volume in different weather conditions, and traffic volume on different holidays.
    These data was uploaded to Tableau. I generated the figures and Dashboard.

      The general conclusions from these data are that the major impact of traffic volume is weather, time of day, and holiday dependent.
